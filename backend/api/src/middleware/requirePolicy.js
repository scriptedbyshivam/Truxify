/**
 * Middleware to enforce policy-based authorization.
 *
 * This middleware evaluates the named policy action against the authenticated
 * user (req.user) and optionally resolves a resource from the request for
 * ownership checks.
 *
 * Note: Authorization logging (grants, denials, unknown actions) is handled
 * internally by policyEngine.authorize(). This middleware only handles HTTP
 * response generation and error propagation — no duplicate logging.
 *
 * Backward Compatible:
 * - Same function signature: requirePolicy(action, getResource)
 * - Same behavior: checks role + optional ownership
 * - Same error responses: 401/403 with { error: message }
 */

 * @param {function} [getResource] - Optional async function that resolves the
 *   resource from req. Called as `getResource(req)` and its return value is
 *   passed to the ownership check. When omitted, the ownership check is
 *   skipped (backward-compatible with existing call sites).
 *
 * A policy that is gated by ownership *alone* (no role restriction) cannot be
 * evaluated without a resource, so omitting `getResource` for such a policy is
 * a misconfiguration. Instead of silently skipping the check (latent IDOR) or
 * always denying (broken endpoint), the middleware fails closed with a clear
 * 500 so the misconfiguration is caught during development.
